**Hello and welcome to Clarify!**

Imagine you were to enter a fight with someone over the web, but have it turn into a fruitful and honest discussion where you feel that they really get you.
Imagine you talked to someone over the web and discovered a point of view you have never seen before. And you'd feel they really connect to you even when you're so different.

The purpose of Clarify is to allow people to communicate with real empathy and understanding over the web.

Clarify experiments with different communication formats and makes it easy to be concise and respectful.
It also makes it hard to fall into verbal traps set by others or by yourself (even unconsciously).

Would you say that today's social media is characterized by people looking to understand each other's point of view respectfully? 
For the majority, it seems to me this is not the case.

People just say whatever whenever, so we put up rules and assign moderators. Clarify doesn't need any of that.

Clarify aims to give a structure to the wild-west that is today's online discourse.

If you ever had a conversation gone bad with a loved one, ever got into a discussion you just wished you had never started, or just felt that no one was listening to you - this is the place for you.
It is time we understand each other online, and that's what Clarify is about.


**Tech Stuff**

This system is written in Typescript (some Javascript) with Node.js.
The main paradigm in this project is Test Driven Development, as promoted by Robert Martive ("Uncle Bob").
The intention is to have this project around for the long run, and TDD seems to be right for that.

Please make sure you are very familiar with Uncle Bob's TDD before diving into the code.
Any questions as to why use TDD, you can gladly send me.
